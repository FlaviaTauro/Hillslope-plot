Four folders are created for each hydrological season. Within folders, each ".xlsx" file contains data for a storm event.
Files are named as follows: year-julian day of the event.
Data within files are organized as follows:

Column C: time of the event in increments of 5 minutes
Column D: rainfall in mm (obtained as the average value of 4 rainfall data from 4 nearby rain gauges)
Column E: stormflow discharge in l/s
Column F: raw soil water content at DD
Column G: raw soil water content at DS 
Column H: raw soil water content at US
Column I: raw soil water content at UD
Column J: normalized soil water content at DD
Column K: normalized soil water content at DS 
Column L: normalized soil water content at US
Column M: normalized soil water content at UD
